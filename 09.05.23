Meeting in HH, 
Alexa, Julia, ilmar 

Impressions of EGU23:
  - A lot of people showed interest in our poster. 
  - There was some explanation regarding why slopes at small ranges do not decline, which was attributed to a resolution issue. 
  - Additionally, there was a suggestion to investigate ocean particles with "Ocean Parcels"

Spectral Fluxes:
  - Maybe we should consider trying another method. We can look up the paper where they compared different methods to calculate fluxes. 
  - It would be beneficial to stay within box 1 for calculations since we have the best resolution there.
  - We should also conduct sensitivity tests by varying the box size, depths, and different averaging methods over depths -> This will help us determine how the slope changes.
  
  Add diagonals to the calculation method of velocity structure functions
  
  Use "Ocean Parcels" for particle tracking within the Model
  
  Nils will probably look into spectral slopes and analysis of Spectral Flux, so we should focus on velocity structure functions.
  
  Prioritization: Continue with particle tracking!
