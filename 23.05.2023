Meeting in HH 23.05.23, 
Maren, Alexa, Julia, ilmar 

Where are we, and how should we continue? 

I have informed everyone about what we discussed in the meeting on 09.05.23 (please look it up if necessary) to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Priority: We should continue with particle tracking within the model to derive velocity structure functions, which we can then compare with the data collected from drifters.
